# Assignment 1

**Assignment due at 11:59pm on Monday 4/19/2010**<br/>
**Demo due by 11:59pm on Monday 5/3/2021**

The goals of this assignment are to have you practice designing a RESTful API from an application description, to begin implementing endpoints for the API you designed, and to containerize your API using Docker.  The assignment has a few different parts, which are outlined below.

## 0. Sign up for Campuswire

This first part of this assignment is simple and doesn't involve coding. Just join our course on Campuswire using your ONID email address. I already sent an email invite to join our Campuswire course to your ONID email address. Alternatively, you can also find a link and invite code to join Campuswire on the homepage of our Canvas site for the course. If you have trouble connecting to our course on Campuswire, please catch up with me after lecture or drop into my office hours, and I’ll help you join.

We'll be using Campuswire as our main communication platform for the course. Campuswire has both a StackOverflow-style Q&A forum, called the "class feed", as well as live chat rooms, so it should hopefully fulfill all of our course communication needs. For this reason, please use Campuswire exclusively for questions you have about the course. I (Hess) and the TAs will be on Campuswire, just like you and your fellow students, so you can feel confident about getting the answers you need there.

I strongly encourage you to also spend time answering your fellow classmates’ questions on Campuswire. This will not only enable everyone to get help quickly, but it will also help you improve your understanding of the material, since teaching someone else is the best way to learn something. As an extra incentive to answer questions on Campuswire, extra credit will be awarded to the most active Campuswire participants at the end of the course (based on Campuswire’s reputation score).

## 1. Design a RESTful API for a Yelp-like application

Your first task for this assignment is to design a RESTful API (i.e. API endpoints with corresponding request and response bodies) for a Yelp-like application.  This application will specifically be centered around businesses and user reviews of businesses in US cities.  The API you design should permit the following functionality:

### Businesses

  * Users who own businesses should be able to add their businesses to the application.  When a business owner adds their business they will need to include the following information:
    * Business name
    * Business street address
    * Business city
    * Business state
    * Business ZIP code
    * Business phone number
    * Business category and subcategories (e.g. category "Restaurant" and subcategory "Pizza")

    The following information may also optionally be included when a new business is added:
      * Business website
      * Business email

  * Business owners may modify any of the information listed above for an already-existing business they own.

  * Business owners may remove a business listing from the application.

  * Users may get a list of businesses.  The representations of businesses in the returned list should include all of the information described above.  In a later assignment, we will implement functionality to allow the user to list only a subset of the businesses based on some filtering criteria, but for now, assume that users will only want to fetch a list of all businesses.

  * Users may fetch detailed information about a business.  Detailed business information will include all of the information described above as well as reviews of the business and photos of the business (which we discuss below).

### Reviews

  * Users may write a review of an existing business.  A review will include the following information:
    * A "star" rating between 0 and 5 (e.g. 4 stars)
    * An "dollar sign" rating between 1 and 4, indicating how expensive the business is (e.g. 2 dollar signs)
    * An optional written review

    Note that a user may write at most one review of any business.

  * Users may modify or delete any review they've written.

### Photos

  * Users may upload image files containing photos of an existing business.  Each photo may have an associated caption.

  * Users may remove any photo they've uploaded, and they may modify the caption of any photo they've uploaded.

  * Users may list all of the businesses they own.

  * Users may list all of the reviews they've written.

  * Users may list all of the photos they've uploaded.

Your design should follow the best practices we're discussing in lecture, such as URL naming, etc.  As you're designing your API, make sure to think about which API responses should be paginated, which API responses should include links to other API resources (i.e. how your API will implement HATEOAS), and what API endpoints will need some form of authentication.  Some of this will come into play in the server implementation you'll write below, while some of it (e.g. authentication) won't come into play until later assignments.

There is no formal deliverable for this part of the assignment, but it will be useful to go through the exercise of designing your API before implementing it, which you'll do in the next step of the assignment.

## 2. Implement a server for your API

After you've designed your API, implement a server for it using Node.js and Express.  Your server should meet the following requirements:

  * Your server API should implement a route for each of the API endpoints in the design you created above.

  * Any API endpoint with a parameterized route should perform basic verification of the specified route parameters.  For example, if you have a route with a parameter representing the ID of a specific business, you should verify that the ID is valid.

  * Any API endpoint that takes a request body should perform basic verification of the data provided in the request body.  You example, if one of your endpoints requires a request body that contains a business name and a business address, you should verify that those two fields are present in the request body.

  * Each API endpoint should respond with an appropriate HTTP status code and, when needed, a response body.

  * API endpoints should have paginated responses where appropriate.

  * Your server should run on the TCP port specified by the `PORT` environment variable.

  * You should be able to launch your server using the command `npm start`.

  * **Importantly, DO NOT worry about actually storing API data in your server.**  When a client makes a request to your API that includes a request body (e.g. a business), you may simply validate the body without storing it.  When a client makes a request to your API that would generate a response body, you can simply send back (hard-coded) dummy data with the appropriate format.

## 3. Write some basic tests for your server

Once your API server is implemented (or, preferably, as you're implementing your server), your next task is to implement some basic tests for your server.  The test should demonstrate the functionality of all of the endpoints you implemented above.  You may use any tool you like to write these tests (e.g. [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/), [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/), etc.).  So that the TA has these tests available when grading your assignment, you should commit and push a representation of these them to your assignment repository on GitHub (e.g. by exporting them from Postman or Insomnia or by writing and committing a shell script with curl commands).

## Submission

We'll be using GitHub Classroom for this assignment, and you will submit your assignment via GitHub.  Just make sure your completed files are committed and pushed by the assignment's deadline to the master branch of the GitHub repo that was created for you by GitHub Classroom.  A good way to check whether your files are safely submitted is to look at the master branch your assignment repo on the github.com website (i.e. https://github.com/osu-cs493-sp21/assignment-1-YourGitHubUsername/). If your changes show up there, you can consider your files submitted.

## Grading criteria

This assignment is worth 100 total points, broken down as follows:

* 20 points: Signed up for Campuswire

* 70 points: Implemented API server
  * 35 points: API server implements a route to allow each piece of functionality described above
  * 10 points: API design reflects best practices for a RESTful API, as discussed in class (e.g. URL naming, etc.)
  * 10 points: API endpoints perform basic verification of route parameters and request bodies
  * 10 points: API endpoints respond with appropriate HTTP status codes and response bodies
  * 5 points: API endpoints send paginated responses when appropriate
